# fa21-cs242-assignment-1
***
The project : Fa21-cs242-Assignment-1.0 contains the framework to create a standard UNO game. 
***
The design is split into 3 main classes which include the Card, Player, and GameState Classes.   
The Card class contains the building blocks of how UNO cards are stored as String combinations   
and includes getters and setters to access attributes of a specific card.   
The Player class initializes the hand of card objects that each player possesses   
and also includes getters and setters to give access to a specific player's hand to the GameState class.   
The GameState Class is used to generate an Instance of the Card Game 'UNO' by utilizing the Player,  
Card, and Deck Classes and contains methods that handles the updating of a single game instance   
after a card and its special effects are applied. This project is currently still under development  
and does not have an implemented Game Loop as of 9/7/2021.
